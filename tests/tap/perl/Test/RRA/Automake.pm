# Helper functions for Perl test programs in Automake distributions.
#
# This module provides a collection of helper functions used by test programs
# written in Perl and included in C source distributions that use Automake.
# They embed knowledge of how I lay out my source trees and test suites with
# Autoconf and Automake.  They may be usable by others, but doing so will
# require closely following the conventions implemented by the rra-c-util
# utility collection.
#
# All the functions here assume that BUILD and SOURCE are set in the
# environment.  This is normally done via the C TAP Harness runtests wrapper.

=head1 NAME

Test::RRA::Automake - Automake-aware support functions for Perl tests

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::RRA::Automake qw(automake_setup perl_dirs test_file_path);
    automake_setup({ chdir_build => 1 });

    # Paths to directories that may contain Perl scripts.
    my @dirs = perl_dirs({ skip => [qw(lib)] });

    # Configuration for Kerberos tests.
    my $keytab = test_file_path('config/keytab');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module collects utility functions that are useful for test scripts
written in Perl and included in a C Automake-based package.  They assume
the layout of a package that uses rra-c-util and C TAP Harness for the
test structure.

Loading this module will also add the directories C<perl/blib/arch> and
C<perl/blib/lib> to the Perl library search path, relative to BUILD if
that environment variable is set.  This is harmless for C Automake
projects that don't contain an embedded Perl module, and for those
projects that do, this will allow subsequent C<use> calls to find modules
that are built as part of the package build process.

The automake_setup() function should be called before calling any other
functions provided by this module.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

None of these functions are imported by default.  The ones used by a
script should be explicitly imported.  On failure, all of these functions
call BAIL_OUT (from Test::More).

=over 4

=item automake_setup([ARGS])

Verifies that the BUILD and SOURCE environment variables are set and
then changes directory to the top of the source tree (which is one
directory up from the SOURCE path, since SOURCE points to the top of
the tests directory).

If ARGS is given, it should be a reference to a hash of configuration
options.  Only one option is supported: C<chdir_build>.  If it is set
to a true value, automake_setup() changes directories to the top of
the build tree instead.

=item perl_dirs([ARGS])

Returns a list of directories that may contain Perl scripts that should be
tested by test scripts that test all Perl in the source tree (such as
syntax or coding style checks).  The paths will be simple directory names
relative to the current directory or two-part directory names under the
F<tests> directory.  (Directories under F<tests> are broken out separately
since it's common to want to apply different policies to different
subdirectories of F<tests>.)

If ARGS is given, it should be a reference to a hash of configuration
options.  Only one option is supported: C<skip>, whose value should be a
reference to an array of additional top-level directories or directories
starting with C<tests/> that should be skipped.

=item test_file_path(FILE)

Given FILE, which should be a relative path, locates that file relative to
the test directory in either the source or build tree.  FILE will be
checked for relative to the environment variable BUILD first, and then
relative to SOURCE.  test_file_path() returns the full path to FILE or
calls BAIL_OUT if FILE could not be found.

=item test_tmpdir()

Create a temporary directory for tests to use for transient files and
return the path to that directory.  The directory is created relative to
the BUILD environment variable, which must be set.  Permissions on the
directory are set using the current umask.  test_tmpdir() returns the full
path to the temporary directory or calls BAIL_OUT if it could not be
created.

The directory is automatically removed if possible on program exit.
Failure to remove the directory on exit is reported with diag() and
otherwise ignored.
