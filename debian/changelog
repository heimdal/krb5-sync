krb5-sync-heimdal (3.0-1) oldstable-kdc; urgency=low

  * Separate Stanford-local krb5-sync package built against Heimdal.  The
    main krb5-sync package is now being built against MIT Kerberos for
    upload to Debian proper.  krb5-sync-heimdal will combine both the
    plugin and the tools package, built against Heimdal, for continued
    Stanford local use with a patched Heimdal KDC until the Heimdal
    support is integrated and the main package can build both plugins.
  * Conflict with the MIT krb5-sync-plugin package.
  * Back out of the multiarch changes, since multiarch was not supported
    in squeeze.

krb5-sync (3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Module name changed to sync.so.  This will require configuration
      changes in the KDC krb5.conf or kdc.conf configuration file in the
      [plugins] section.
    - The ad_ldap_base configuration parameter must now contain the full
      DN of the tree in Active Directory where account information is
      stored, and is now mandatory for status synchronization.
    - New option ad_base_instance, which allows an instance's password to
      be synchronized to the unqualified principal name in Active
      Directory.
    - New option ad_queue_only that, if set to true, forces queuing of all
      changes rather than pushing any changes immediately.
    - New option syslog that, if set to false, suppresses supplemental
      syslog logging of notice, info, and debug messages.
    - All failed Active Directory password changes are now queued, instead
      of just those that returned specific errors.
    - krb5-sync-backend now requires its parameters be given after the
      subcommand.
    - krb5-sync-backend now supports a -d option to specify the path to
      the queue directory.
    - krb5-sync-backend process skips queue files that no longer exist by
      the time we get to them.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.5 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 09 Dec 2013 22:58:10 -0800

krb5-sync (2.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.4.
    - Add Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser control fields.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sat, 11 May 2013 16:57:12 -0700

krb5-sync (2.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Also protect against a NULL password on Heimdal.
    - Ignore "Operation not permitted" errors in krb5-sync-backend when
      running in silent mode.
  * Switch to xz compression for the upstream and Debian tarballs and the
    Debian packages.
  * Mark krb5-sync-tools Multi-Arch: foreign.
  * Remove debugging display of config.log from the build rules.
  * Convert debian/copyright to copyright-format 1.0.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.3 (no changes required).
  
 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Sep 2012 13:17:43 -0700

krb5-sync (2.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream commit to silently ignore password changes with a NULL
    password, only new keys.  This represents a key randomization, such as
    from addprinc -randkey, which is outside the synchronization scope of
    this package.  Without this change, the plugin would segfault on that
    operation.  (Closes: #687346)

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Sep 2012 20:24:01 -0700

krb5-sync (2.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix debian/rules syntax for setting hardening flags and enable bindnow
    and PIE.
  * Regenerate the Autotools build system with dh-autoreconf.
  * Bump debhelper dependency to 9 now that compatibility mode V9 is no
    longer experimental.
  * Move single-debian-patch to local-options and patch-header to
    local-patch-header so that they only apply to the packages I build and
    NMUs get regular version-numbered patches.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 07 Feb 2012 17:14:21 -0800

krb5-sync (2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial upload to Debian.  (Closes: #655396)
  * New upstream release.
    - Add support for the hooks provided by MIT Kerberos 1.9.
    - Quietly skip -randkey password changes under MIT Kerberos.
    - krb5-sync-backend accepts the password on standard input.
    - krb5-sync diagnoses missing configuration instead of segfaulting.
  * Split the package into krb5-sync-plugin and krb5-sync-tools packages,
    since the former needs to be multiarch.
  * Add Breaks and Replaces on the old internal krb5-sync package to
    krb5-sync-tools.  This is unnecessary for Debian but helpful for the
    transition at Stanford and will be removed once that transition is
    complete.
  * Update to experimental debhelper compatibility level V9.
    - krb5-sync-plugin is multiarch.
    - Enable hardening build flags.
  * Recommend krb5-admin-server 1.9 or later in the plugin package.  This
    isn't the best way to express the dependency, since the plugin is
    actually loaded by libkadm5srv, but otherwise we have to depend on the
    specific SONAME of libkadm5srv even though any version of the package
    will do.  This will capture the most common scenarios.
  * Restart krb5-admin-server if it's running when the plugin is
    configured to ensure the latest version is loaded.
  * Update the krb5-sync-plugin README.Debian for the built-in support for
    loading this plugin in MIT Kerberos 1.9 and later and to provide a
    sample of the krb5.conf configuration required.
  * Update the package description and dependencies to reflect that it's
    now specific to MIT Kerberos.
  * Remove the special bug reporting address, as this package is now in
    Debian proper.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.2 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Jan 2012 14:36:33 -0800

krb5-sync (2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix suppression of error messages in krb5-sync-backend -s.
    - Suppress Heimdal service_locator plugin error messages in
      krb5-sync-backend if -s is given.
    - Avoid deprecated OpenLDAP functions.
  * Recommend heimdal-kdc, not krb5-admin-server, since the package is now
    built as a Heimdal plugin.  Eventually (before uploading to Debian)
    we'll build both plugins using the -multidev packages.
  * Direct bug reports against this package to me personally.
  * Switch to 3.0 (quilt) source format.  Force a single Debian patch and
    include a custom patch header explaining that it is a rollup of any
    fixes cherry-picked from upstream and breaking those patches out
    separately would be work for no gain.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.1 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Thu, 26 Aug 2010 18:06:27 -0700

krb5-sync (2.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Queue password changes for AD for any password change failure.
    Heimdal may return a missing plugin error rather than the regular
    password change failure message if the account doesn't exist.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun, 16 May 2010 11:13:01 -0700

krb5-sync (2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

    - Add an ad_ldap_base configuration option to specify the base DN for
      Active Directory.
    - Ignore connection timeouts from AD when running the queue via
      krb5-sync-backend in silent mode.
    - Improve error reporting in krb5-sync.
  * Built against Heimdal Kerberos instead of MIT Kerberos.
  * No longer restart kadmind on package installation, since the
    convention for Heimdal is to run kadmind from inetd.
  * Update debhelper compatibility level to V7.
    - Use debhelper rule minimization with overrides.
    - Add ${misc:Depends} to dependencies.
  * Add a watch file.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.4 (no changes required).

    - Add krb5-sync-backend -s option to filter out some messages.
    - Log krb5-sync actions as LOG_AUTH.
    - Don't repeat the realm in AD status change log messages.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 13 Aug 2007 18:02:10 -0700

krb5-sync (0.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Better logging of plugin failures leading to queuing.
    - Log krb5-sync actions as LOG_AUTHPRIV, not LOG_DAEMON.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 07 Aug 2007 10:46:35 -0700

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Fri, 13 Jul 2007 13:41:45 -0700

krb5-sync (0.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Create /var/spool/krb5-sync/.lock as part of package installation
    since krb5-sync-backend requires that it exist.
  * Install a lintian override for the shlib-with-non-pic-code error.
    This is unavoidable as long as we have to link with AFS code.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Fri, 29 Jun 2007 18:43:52 -0700

krb5-sync (0.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Obtain new AFS tokens for each operation to avoid expiration.
    - Queue AD changes rather than rejecting for non-existent users.
    - Queue AD changes if there's already a queued change.
    - Include the username in krb5-sync status messages.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Mar 2007 16:54:39 -0700

krb5-sync (0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Added queuing of status and AFS password changes on failure.
    - Fail/queue if a change is already queued for that user and action.
    - Added krb5-sync-backend to manage the queue.
  * Update upstream authorship information.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 23 Jan 2007 16:27:44 -0800

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Thu, 14 Dec 2006 16:20:00 -0800

krb5-passwd-sync (0.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * In ad-modify, set the ticket cache appropriately so that SASL inside
    the LDAP libraries doesn't just use the default cache.
  * Our AD stores accounts under ou=Accounts, not cn=Users.
  * Log a message to syslog when we propagate status.
  * Report error messages to syslog rather than standard error so that we
    can see what's going on.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 11 Dec 2006 14:15:14 -0800

krb5-passwd-sync (0.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Point the compile-time hard-coded realms (ugh) and the configuration
    file at the test environment for right now.
  * Hard-code a slightly more useful path to the K4 srvtab.
  * When syncing with Kerberos v4, use the kaserver interface.

  * Link against the proper Kerberos v4 libraries.
  * Add some error handling to the Kerberos v4 password changing.
  * Use a different Kerberos v4 principal.
  * Fix the build machinery to actually set the foreign realm.
