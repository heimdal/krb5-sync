Description: Heimdal KDC plugin for password synchronization
 This plugin synchronizes passwords changed via kadmind to a foreign realm
 via the Kerberos password change protocol.  It can also propagate changes
 to the disallow-all-tix flag to Windows Active Directory using LDAP.  It
 is built against Heimdal Kerberos but requires a patched version of
 Heimdal's libkadm5srv library to be called by kadmin, kadmind, and
 kpasswdd.
 .
 This package is a Stanford-specific version of the krb5-sync plugin
 built against Heimdal rather than MIT Kerberos.

Description: Kerberos Active Directory synchronization tools
 Provides tools to enable, disable, and set the password of an account in
 a Windows Active Directory using the same configuration used by the
 krb5-sync-plugin package.  These supporting tools are normally used to
 handle queued changes created by the plugin that failed due to a
 temporary error, but can be used on their own.
