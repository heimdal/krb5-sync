.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBkrb5\-sync\-backend\fR provides an interface to the queue of pending
password and account status changes written by either this utility or by
the synchronization plugin after failures.  It can queue account enables,
disables, or password changes for Active Directory, list the queued
actions, or process the queued actions with \fBkrb5\-sync\fR (telling it to
take its action from a file).
.PP
The queue directory will contain files with names in the format:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    <username>\-<domain>\-<action>\-<timestamp>\-<count>
.Ve
.PP
where <username> is the name of the affected account (\f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR will be
replaced with \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR in the file name and the realm will be removed),
<domain> is \f(CW\*(C`ad\*(C'\fR, <action> is either \f(CW\*(C`enable\*(C'\fR (used for both enabling
and disabling accounts) or \f(CW\*(C`password\*(C'\fR, <timestamp> is a \s-1ISO 8601\s0
timestamp in \s-1UTC,\s0 and <count> is a two-digit zero-padded number between 0
and 99 (so that we can handle multiple changes that arrive in the same
second).  Each file contains a queued change in the format described in
\&\fIkrb5\-sync\fR\|(8).
.PP
Supported arguments to \fBkrb5\-sync\-backend\fR are:
.IP "disable \fIuser\fR" 4
.IX Item "disable user"
Queue a disable action (in Active Directory, as that's the only system
currently supported for enable and disable) for \fIuser\fR.
.IP "enable \fIuser\fR" 4
.IX Item "enable user"
Queue an enable action (in Active Directory, as that's the only system
currently supported for enable and disable) for \fIuser\fR.
.IP "help" 4
.IX Item "help"
List the supported commands.
.IP "list" 4
.IX Item "list"
List the current contents of the queue.
.IP "manual" 4
.IX Item "manual"
Display this documentation.
.IP "process" 4
.IX Item "process"
Process the queue.  All queued actions will be sorted alphanumerically
(which due to the timestamp means that all changes for a particular user of
a particular type will be done in the order queued).  \fBkrb5\-sync\fR will be
called for each queued action, as long as it continues to succeed.  If it
fails for a queued action, all other actions sharing the same username,
domain, and action will be skipped and queue processing will continue with
the next action that differs in one of those three parameters.
.IP "password \fIuser\fR ad < \fIpassword\fR" 4
.IX Item "password user ad < password"
Queue a password change for \fIuser\fR in Active Directory, setting their
password to \fIpassword\fR.  By default, \fIpassword\fR is read from standard input.
It can also be passed as a command-line argument, but this is less secure
since the password is then readable by anyone on the system who can see the
command-line arguments of processes.
.Sp
The entire standard input is taken as the password, including any trailing
newlines, so be careful how the password is provided.  If using something like
\&\fBecho\fR, use \f(CW\*(C`echo \-n\*(C'\fR or the \f(CW\*(C`\ec\*(C'\fR flag, depending on your system.
.IP "purge \fIdays\fR" 4
.IX Item "purge days"
Delete all queued actions last modified longer than \fIdays\fR days ago.  This
can be used to clean up old failed change propagations in situations where
accounts may be created or have password changes queued that are later
removed and never created in other environments.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
Options must be specified after the command.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR \fIqueue\fR, \fB\-\-directory\fR=\fIqueue\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d queue, --directory=queue"
Use \fIqueue\fR as the queue directory instead of the default of
\&\fI/var/spool/krb5\-sync\fR.  This also changes the lock file accordingly.  This
option is supported for all commands except \f(CW\*(C`help\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`manual\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-silent\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s, --silent"
This option is only allowed for the \f(CW\*(C`process\*(C'\fR command.  Filter out the
output of \fBkrb5\-sync\fR to ignore common errors and success messages and
only show uncommon errors.  This option will filter out all output when
\&\fBkrb5\-sync\fR is successful and will filter out error messages that
normally indicate the account is missing in Active Directory.  The regexes
can be modified at the start of this script.
.SH "FILES"
.IX Header "FILES"
.IP "\fI/usr/sbin/krb5\-sync\fR" 4
.IX Item "/usr/sbin/krb5-sync"
The path to the \fBkrb5\-sync\fR utility.  This may be changed at the top of
this script.
.IP "\fI/var/spool/krb5\-sync\fR" 4
.IX Item "/var/spool/krb5-sync"
The default path to the queue.  This must match the queue_dir parameter in
\&\fIkrb5.conf\fR used by the plugin.  It can be changed at the top of this
script.
.IP "\fI/var/spool/krb5\-sync/.lock\fR" 4
.IX Item "/var/spool/krb5-sync/.lock"
An empty file used for locking the queue.  When writing to or querying the
queue, \fBkrb5\-sync\-backend\fR will open and lock this file with the Perl flock
function, which normally calls \fIflock\fR\|(2).  Any other queue writers need to
use the same locking mechanism for safe operation.
